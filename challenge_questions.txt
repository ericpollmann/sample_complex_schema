        CHALLENGE QUESTIONS FOR LLM AGENT TESTING
        ========================================
        
        CHALLENGE 1: Suspicious Transaction Patterns
        --------------------------------------------
        Question: "I'm investigating potential structuring activity. Can you find any accounts with 
        multiple cash withdrawals just under the $500 reporting threshold within a short time period? 
        Who owns these accounts and what's unusual about their profile?"
        
        Expected Discovery:
        - Customer ID 250 has 50+ ATM withdrawals between $495-$499 within 30 days
        - This customer is marked as a Politically Exposed Person (PEP) with HIGH risk rating
        - Their account balance is disproportionate to declared income
        - Transactions occurred across multiple geographic locations
        - Account shows 47 failed login attempts and has been deactivated
        
        
        CHALLENGE 2: Account Relationship Anomalies  
        --------------------------------------------
        Question: "We've received reports about possible identity theft involving multiple accounts 
        opened with suspiciously similar information. Can you identify any customer groups that share 
        the same address but might not be legitimately related? What concerning patterns do you see 
        in their loan payment history?"
        
        Expected Discovery:
        - Customers 101, 102, 103 (Johnson family) all share addresses on Oak Street in Miami
        - They have a joint account together (account 151)
        - All three have defaulted loans with 30-90 days delinquency
        - Payment patterns show irregular partial payments after month 12
        - High volume of customer complaints and negative sentiment in chat history
        - This could indicate synthetic identity fraud or family financial distress
        
        
        CHALLENGE 3: Loan Payment Discrepancies
        --------------------------------------------
        Question: "Our accounting team noticed some reversed payments that weren't properly 
        investigated. Can you find any loans where payments were reversed and determine if this 
        correlates with any other suspicious account activity or customer service interactions?"
        
        Expected Discovery:
        - Loan ID 150 had a payment reversal in month 15 due to insufficient funds
        - Need to trace the customer and check their transaction history
        - Look for patterns of disputes or complaints in chat history
        - Check if this customer has other delinquent accounts
        - Investigate if there's a pattern of NSF fees or overdrafts
        
        
        TIPS FOR LLM AGENTS:
        -------------------
        1. Start with broad queries to understand table relationships
        2. Use JOINs effectively to connect customer, account, transaction, and loan data
        3. Look for statistical anomalies (e.g., GROUP BY and HAVING clauses)
        4. Consider time-based patterns and geographic inconsistencies
        5. Cross-reference multiple data points to build a complete picture
        6. Pay attention to risk indicators: failed logins, PEP status, sentiment scores
